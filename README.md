=======

Live version is available at: http://guney.herokuapp.com/

Guney is a simple chatbot based on Markov chains made purely for fun. Markov chain generator used here is based on https://github.com/hrs/markov-sentence-generator

Guney's responses are generated from a Sinhala corpus which can be found at
[UCSC LTRL](http://www.ucsc.cmb.ac.lk/ltrl/?page=downloads&lang=en&style=default) website.
A preprocessed version of the corpus is availble in this repo.
